We tried to maximise our Tinder ratio with models to understand what make us match or not. The models went well, we had good results. We still have 0 match on Tinder tho 

If you are a woman our XGBoost and RandomForest showed us that men make their choice based on the woman looking (attractiveness) and their intelligence. Other parameters come just after like shared interests. 

If you are a man our XGBoost and RandomForest showed us that women make their choice depending of shared interest, attractiveness and if you are fun enough (do sport, go out, cinema, restaurant, etc...).
